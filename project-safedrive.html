                <h2>Why I Started This</h2>
                <p>I was really pissed. Every day on my commute, I'd see someone on their phone while driving—texting at red lights, scrolling through feeds, even watching videos. It's dangerous, it's illegal, and honestly, it made me angry.</p>
                <p>But here's the thing: I had no idea how many people were actually doing it. Was it 10%? 30%? More? I couldn't find any objective data to back up what I was seeing. Without real numbers, it's just complaints. I wanted facts.</p>

                <h2>Building a Solution</h2>
                <p>So I built <a href="https://gnss.ch" target="_blank">gnss.ch</a>—a simple tool to get a clear, objective picture of the problem. The idea is straightforward: me and my friends can quickly log observations whenever we spot someone driving with their phone. No complicated forms, no hassle—just simple tracking.</p>
                
                <p>Over time, these observations add up. We start to see actual percentages, patterns, and trends. It's not about calling people out; it's about understanding the real scope of the issue with concrete data.</p>

                <h2>What I'm Trying to Achieve</h2>
                <p>My goal isn't to get individual drivers in trouble—I'm not trying to report specific people. Instead, I want to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get real numbers:</strong> Move beyond "I see this all the time" to "X% of drivers are doing this"</li>
                    <li><strong>Involve others:</strong> My friends can contribute their observations too, so we get data from different areas and times</li>
                    <li><strong>Share with authorities:</strong> Once we have solid data, make it available to police and traffic safety officials so they can make informed decisions about where to focus their efforts</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it objective:</strong> This is about the bigger picture—understanding the scale of the problem, not getting anyone in trouble</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>What started as frustration turned into action. By collecting this data, we can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have fact-based conversations about how common distracted driving really is</li>
                    <li>Help authorities understand where the problem is worst</li>
                    <li>Support better-informed traffic safety policies and education campaigns</li>
                    <li>Maybe even make people think twice when they see the actual numbers</li>
                </ul>
